Repo for UFSC's Expolouro project, PoInt

# What's this?
This GIT Repo refers to a project made by me and 3 other students.

# Ok... But what project?
Me and the mentioned students are from UFSC, an university from Santa Catarina-Brazil.
As a final project for a course, we did a trafic control system to read and display the time for arrival of a certain bus line at a bus stop. The project had also an audio support to inform the calculated time, an app to inform the user, and a error adjustment system, which made the project's system adaptable to changes while running.

# And where is the documentation so I can understand it better?
Unfortunatly, at the time I had no idea what GIT was and some of the files were lost or mixed up, so I couldn't document and upload the project propoerly.
